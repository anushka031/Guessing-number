Guess the Number Game
A simple interactive Python game where the computer guesses your number, and you guide it by providing hints like "Too Low," "Too High," or "Correct!".

How It Works:
Think of a Number: Choose a number in your mind within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
1. Computer Guesses: The computer will try to guess your number.
2.Provide Hints: Indicate whether the computer's guess is:
3. Low: If the guessed number is too small.
4. High: If the guessed number is too large.
5. Correct: If the computer guesses your number.
6. The game ends when the computer correctly guesses your number.

Features
1. Interactive Gameplay: Fun back-and-forth between you and the computer.
2. Efficient Guessing: Uses a binary search algorithm to guess efficiently.
3. Customizable Range: You can set the minimum and maximum number for the guessing range.
